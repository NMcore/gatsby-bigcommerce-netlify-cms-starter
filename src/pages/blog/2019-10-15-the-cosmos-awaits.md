Skiers at different experience levels may have different expectations when it comes to boot sizing. Our ski boot size chart is designed to provide the average skier with a safe, comfortable fit. However, if you are looking for a true performance-skier's fit (which will be about one half to one full size smaller), use our mondo ski boot sizing chart.

Kids with growing feet present a different issue when it comes to ski boot sizing. No parent want to buy expensive ski boots and only use them a handful of times before their child grows out of them. For this reason, many parents opt for adjustable ski boots which we highly recommend. It is also possible to size up slightly for novice child skiers without too much performance sacrifice. For more adept kids, sizing up may hinder improvement. When asking what size ski boots does my child need, it's important to balance performance against lifetime value.

## ALPINE SKI BOOTS

If you haven't spent much time skiing, you probably think that ski boots are hard, uncomfortable things. And if you have a poor-fitting pair, that will certainly be the case. The wrong ski boots will also make you tire faster on the slopes, not to mention the blisters you might have at the end of the day. But that doesn't have to be the case! We're going to help you choose the right pair of ski boots, so you can ski all day and have fun doing it.

There are two main types of ski boots. Alpine boots (also known as downhill ski boots) are made for skiing at a resort. The other kind, Alpine touring boots, are designed for backcountry skiing, where you have to climb up before you can ski down. We'll cover both types and explain some of the general features and characteristics you need to know about when shopping for ski boots.
